# Mini Calendar

I've created a really cool mini calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page displays the current date and has a simple, minimalist design.

But the most exciting part is that I've used JavaScript to dynamically get the current date and display it on the page. This means that no matter when you access the page, it will always show the current date.

I achieved this by using JavaScript's **`Date`** object to get the current date, and then dynamically updating the HTML on the page to display that date. This way, the calendar is always up-to-date, without me having to manually change the date every day.

Overall, it's a really cool and useful project that showcases the power and versatility of JavaScript for web development. Plus, it's a great way to keep track of the date and stay organized!
